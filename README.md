## Overview
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for recovery and to prevent the spread of the disease. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to automate the diagnosis of malaria from microscopic images of blood smears.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of blood smear images, labeled as infected or uninfected. The dataset is imported using TensorFlow datasets, which provides an easy and efficient way to access and preprocess the data.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model used in this project consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The architecture is designed to effectively capture the features of blood smear images and classify them accurately.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 90.7% on the test set.
